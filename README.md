EVENT PLANNER & GENERATOR (EPG)

EPG will allow users to schedule and generate events according to their activity preferences. Users are also able to create and update their calendar with events and invite other users to join them. If a user has no event scheduled, the application can recommend activity based on userâ€™s preference, time, and accessibility.
